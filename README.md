Each heavy chain of the antibody is composed of the recombination of a specific V, D, and J gene segment. As Dr. Chapes has talked about previously, we're interested in the ontogeny of these CDR3s. Biologically, even if two different heavy chains have the SAME CDR3, if they do not have the same V/D/J Gene segments, they cannot be related.

Sample date is in `scripts\Example_Data.xlsx`

`scripts\vgene_exclusion.py` - Will exclude V-GENEs that are biologically not removes any V-gene segment that isn't biologically possible. Only if atleast 1 biologically possible gene segment remains in this column the CDR3 is included for analysis.
